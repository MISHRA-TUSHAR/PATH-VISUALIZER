**Path Visualizer**


A Flutter-based mobile application to visualize Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

**Overview**


The Path Visualizer app is an interactive tool to visualize how Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm works. Users can define the start point, end point, and obstacles on a grid. On running the algorithm, the app shows the path from start to end, avoiding the obstacles and using the shortest possible route.

**Features**


Interactive Grid: Users can tap on cells to set starting and ending points, and also define walls or obstacles.
Visualization: Shows visited nodes and the final shortest path.
Customizable Grid: Grid size can be adjusted as per user requirements.
Tooltip Indicators: Provides tooltips for each type of node (Start, End, Path, Wall, etc.).


**Prerequisite:**

Flutter SDK


Dart


**Usage**


1.Tap on a grid cell to set the starting point.


2.Tap on another cell to set the ending point.


3.Add walls or obstacles by tapping on other cells.


4.Click on 'Start Algorithm' to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm.


5.Use 'Reset Grid' to clear all and start fresh.
